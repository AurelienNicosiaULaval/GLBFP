Description: Implements nonparametric density estimation with Averaged Shifted
    Histogram (ASH), Linear Blend Frequency Polygon (LBFP), and General Linear
    Blend Frequency Polygon (GLBFP) estimators. The package provides pointwise
    and grid-based estimation workflows for one and two-dimensional settings,
    including plotting helpers and plug-in bandwidth selection.
